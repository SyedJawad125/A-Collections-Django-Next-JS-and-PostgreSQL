Alizay Collections is a premium eCommerce web application built with Next.js 14 on the frontend and Django REST Framework on the backend.

The platform implements a secure refresh token–based authentication system, ensuring robust user sessions and enhanced security.

Through the Admin Dashboard, authorized users can efficiently create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) product categories and products, manage company employee records, monitor inventory, add new products, and oversee sales operations — all after secure login.

On the public side, customers enjoy a seamless shopping experience, allowing them to easily browse collections, add products to their cart, and complete purchases with confidence and convenience.
